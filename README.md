# Fashion Journalism and Chatbots - Supporting data

This repository contains the supporting data (code, images, models) for Maria Pilar Uribe Silva's master thesis _Fashion Journalism and Chatbots: A Quantitative Analysis of Potential Benefits and Risks Associated with the Adoption of AI-based Digital Tools for Sustainable Fashion Content Creation_.

The repository directories are structured as follows:
* `gephi`: source files and generated images for the Gephi analysis
* `graphics`: various images produced for the thesis
* `notebook`: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for the general data analysis, Word Embedding and Topic Modeling, plus the Word2Vec models trained on the dataset
* `spiders`: the Scrapy spiders built to gather the dataset
* `stylo`: input files and images generated via the R/Stylo package
* `voyant`: images produced by Voyant

Note that, for copyright reasons, the data files used for the analysis are not included in this repository. The `prepare_data.ipynb`, however, should be of help in regenerating the data for analysis reproducibility.
